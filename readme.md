# override_ios_simulator_status

This repo contains a bash script with a command that runs `xcrun simctl status_bar <device> override` for each currently open iOS simulator. The arguments are the same as they are for `xcrun simctl status_bar <device> override`; run `xcrun simctl help status_bar` for those arguments.
